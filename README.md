### Technologies
 - Dart
 - Flutter
 - Firebase Cloud Firestore
 - Firebase Cloud Storage
 - Firebase Cloud Messaging
 - Firebase Functions (Node.JS)
 - Stripe (Payment system)

### Brief Description
As a group of 4 we created a mobile app that connects service providers (primarily targeted towards those providing services around the home) and customers.
Using the app service providers may create listings that the app will then show to users registered as clients. Clients may book an appoinment with a
service provider and pay for the service. Once the user has picked a date and time, provided their address, and paid for an appointment they then have the ability
to message the service provider. Users receive real time notifications of messages even when the app is open using Firebase Cloud Messaging.

### Technologies
 - C++
 - SFML
 - IMGUI
### Brief Description
As a group of 4 we created a top-down single player space retro themed game using C++, SFML, and ImGUI. The game followed the
ECS (entity component system) architecture. We implemented a parallax background that moved as the player moved, various enemy AI including that
attacks when a player is in sight or applies a status effect preventing the player from moving if the player is within a configurable radius,
gravity tiles and a level editor.
